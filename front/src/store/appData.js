It was originally best known by its full name, but soon came to have other names, such as the American Revised Version, the American Standard Revision, the American Standard Revised Bible, and the American Standard Edition. By the time its copyright was renewed in 1929, it had come to be known by its present name, the American Standard Version. Because of its prominence in seminaries, it was sometimes simply called the \"Standard Bible\" in the United States."

Hooke using the standard 850 Basic English words. 100 words that were helpful to understand poetry were added along with 50 'Bible' words for a total of 1,000 words. This version is effective in communicating the Bible to those with limited education or where English is a second language.

He wrote in the preface to the first edition, \"It has been no part of the Translator's plan to attempt to form a New Hebrew or Greek Textâ€”he has therefore somewhat rigidly adhered to the received ones.\""
